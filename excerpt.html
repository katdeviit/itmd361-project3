          <p>
            Recently, I decided to look into using my diagnosis in order to get
            accommodations that I thought would be helpful to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a senior in high school who has committed to a university, I was
            looking at the procedures at my uni for accommodations related to
            autism or ADHD. I was also looking at AP testing accommodations from
            the College Board (which I could write a whole blog on how awful the
            College Board is, but it's a story that's been written 1,000 times).
          </p>
          <p>
            What I discovered is: It sucks. It really sucks to try and get
            accommodations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing, and I mean nothing is easy about the process. This is
            definitely something my parents are aware of, but... just. Wow. So,
            let me get into
            <em>why</em> it sucks. For this, we're going to use my university's
            guidelines for ADHD accommodations.
          </p>

          <h2 id="universitys-requirements">University's Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            <a
              href="https://www.iit.edu/sites/default/files/2020-10/cdr-add-adhd-guidelines.pdf"
              >Here</a
            >
            is a link to a PDF file from my university listing what is needed to
            request accommodations. I cannot stress how ableist, classist, and
            maliciously ignorant this document is. Especially for a college-aged
            student who is able to understand their own needs and self-advocate,
            which understandably is not a privilege everyone has, but how can
            you expect
            <em>anyone</em> to self-advocate with this type of work needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me break down some of the things here for anyone who doesn't see
            my reasoning. First of all, having ADHD, a huge struggle of mine is
            actually doing things that I don't feel actively engaged by despite
            knowing and wanting to do them (executive dysfunction). There is no
            other way to describe this document, and what it requires, then as
            <em>unengaging</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So on the very first point, this document has already failed to
            promote self-advocacy and is ableist. Of course, not every document
            that triggers my executive dysfunction is ableist. There is some
            level at which I should be expected to function, but the
            requirements are extremely excessive to the point of ableism,
            because the very purpose of the requirements is to
            <em>get help</em> and allow me to function more easily. The
            requirements are a direct hinderance to the ultimate goal of the
            document.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't see why the requirements are excessive, I'm going to
            tell a little story. The first two requirements are for a full
            psychiatric evaluation from a psychologist or psychiatrist within
            the last 3 years. The last time I received a full evaluation was...
            2011? 2012? I haven't been evaluated since I was diagnosed with
            ADHD. Why? It's not necessary.
          </p>
          <p>Okay, fine, so I need an evaluation. I can just go get one!</p>
          <p>
            Nope! Here's where the story comes in. When I was starting
            medication for my ADHD this January, I first was perscribed by my
            family doctor. After the medication I tried gave me severe side
            effects, my doctor was unable to perscribe me additional medication
            without me getting a recommendation from either psychiatry or
            neurology. Generally, psychiatry is the better option for evaluating
            what medication will work for you. So I tried to get an appointment
            with psychiatry. What I discovered was I would probably not get one
            until
            <strong>June</strong>. Six months later. Right now I would be
            unmedicated, in a significantly worse place mentally, and failing
            school.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it takes six months to get an evaluation, and I move in August,
            and I haven't selected where I will be attending until May... nobody
            will be getting an evaluation, unless they have money. That's where
            the classism comes in. Access to better healthcare in the U.S. is
            <em>highly</em> dictated by your income. So now we're dishing out
            accommodations based on income? Good look, guys.
          </p>
          <p>
            So whatever, say I get an evaluation somehow. Now I need an
            evaluation summary with a diagnostic interview? What is that? What?
            The only thing I can find out of this is "based on more sources than
            the student's self-report", which just screams "I don't think
            disabled people are able to understand their own issues on a high
            level".
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, I need testing that validates the current impact of my
            conditions on my academic function. Right, the "I am disabled" test!
            So they can verify I hate my life! Right. Here's a video of me
            screaming at how ableist you are. Does this prove that you are
            disabling me enough? Am I struggling enough for you? The point is,
            not everything is visible now, and some things are precautions to
            take because they might be an issue, and the bureaucracy doesn't let
            me change these things very quickly, so I'd rather do it now. I'll
            talk about this more later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh boy, point 5. "A specific diagnosis (not merely a reference to
            symptoms)". This one is the king of classism.
            <strong>NOT EVERYONE CAN GET A DIAGNOSIS</strong>. FOR MANY REASONS.
            The U.S. healthcare system is awful, and getting a diagnosis is
            usually just a challenge of seeing enough doctors until one agrees,
            or obtaining evaluations proving the DSM criteria (six months for
            that!). This is a challenge of how much money you're willing to
            spend on healthcare, or how much money you already have for health
            insurance. It's also neuronormative. The fact you would require this
            for something like ADHD or autism clearly shows you have no
            understanding of basic human respect. If you haven't read my blog on
            neurodiversity, I would suggest you do so, but the point is
            regardless of if you think I have ADHD or not, if I know that I have
            problems with executive function, I should be able to attain
            accommodations. A diagnosis should never be a pre-requisite for
            basic human respect in the form of accommodations.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, I'd need a clinical summary with the following:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              An indication that other possible causes of the presenting
              behavior have been ruled out.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            So... You want my doctor to write this? "We thought he might just be
            lazy, but then we made him do sit-ups. While he wasn't very good at
            those, he tried. Therefore, we've decided he's not lazy, he's just
            weak." The whole requirement just leaves bad taste. It acts like
            it's my job (or, my psychiatrist's job) to prove I'm autistic or
            ADHD enough. It's gross. The words "presenting behavior" just remind
            me of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis"
              >ABA</a
            >, which is basically
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"
              >Pavlov dogging</a
            >
            a person because you don't like how they respond to situations.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              A description of functional limitations and the impact of the
              condition on the student’s current participation in courses,

            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Here's something to consider. I might not <em>know</em> right now! I
            might not have these issues yet, because I'm not in university. What
            I do know, is myself! I do know that I <em>might</em> need some
            accommodations. If I know this, why should I wait until I have these
            issues? I can request them, try them, and if it turns out I don't
            need them, great! We'll change things up. This also limits my
            ability to get an evaluation, because this is required as a part of
            a clinical summary. That means my evaluation has to take place after
            I am already experiencing a need for accommodations (6 months
            more!).
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Recommendations for academic accommodations, including a rationale
              for each.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I will say, this is reasonable. If I were to do this myself (which I
            am not, I have to get a doctor to tell them this!), I would be able
            to rationalize my needs within the context of what I know about
            myself. If I can't, then I can have an evaluator do it, or have a
            third party write what they know about me.

          <h2 id="ap-requirements">AP Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            After discovering all the excessive requirements for my university,
            I decided to move on. Shortly after, I realized AP tests were coming
            up, and they're online, at home, and prime stressors!
          </p>
          <p>
            I also realized that during stressful tests where I don't know the
            majority of the answers (a 60%-70% on an AP test is considered
            passing and roughly average), I tend to get <em>very</em> stressed
            and need breaks. So I turned to my 504 plan! Breaks in class! I
            looked at the
            <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/getting-accommodations"
              >College Board website for information on accommodations</a
            >, saw the listed accommodations, saw "Breaks as needed", and
            thought... Wow, that'll be helpful! It said to email my school's
            disability services coordinator to discuss accommodations. So I did
            that. I emailed them with a list of accommodations and my rationale.
          </p>
          <p>Here is my email's contents:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I was specifically looking to get these that they listed on their
              info page:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Breaks as needed</li>
              <li>Extended time (150%) (only for math)</li>
              <li>4-function calculator</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My reasoning for the above are as follows:</p>
            <p>
              Breaks: These are already included on my 504, which makes things
              easier. If something is not going well during the exam I could get
              very overwhelmed, very unexpectedly. Breaks as needed allows me
              time to cool down if this happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Extended time: When doing math problems I get very invested in my
              answer- if it's a decimal I might try to simplify or make it exact
              even if the decimal answer is correct or close to correct. This
              can lead to me taking longer than most people on math problems,
              especially in Calculus where there is a lot of estimation. The
              time is for more breathing room as I will inevitably follow some
              of my habits regardless of how much practice I do.
            </p>
            <p>
              4-function calculator: I can't do basic math under pressure, and a
              4-function calculator when doing real world math is never not
              going to be an option. I could do mental math, yes, but it would
              hurt my head a lot. As I often say to myself when doing very
              "computational" homework assignments that don't include much
              actual mathematical skills outside 4-functions "I am not a
              computer". I am really not. Most of the points I lose currently in
              math classes are because I failed to perform basic addition or
              multiplication properly, calculator or not. I feel like the
              College Board might be harder to persuade with this one because of
              my good math track record, but it would be beneficial.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            How reasonable, drawn out, and based in my history these requests
            are! I sure do hope the College Board will listen!
          </p>
          <p>Here is the response I received:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Thank you for reaching out to me. I am so impressed with your
              level of self advocacy and responsibility! Way to go!!!
            </p>
            <p>
              Your current 504 does not have the accommodations that you have
              requested. The College Board typically only accepts accommodations
              that the student is currently using in the school. They don't
              usually let schools add additional accommodations that haven't
              been in place just for testing.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I replied, stating it was fine if I couldn't get extended time or a
            4-function calculator, but that my 504 did include breaks, and I
            could probably get that. Unfortunately...
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Because you don't currently have breaks during testing (written
              that way in the 504 plan) we didn't apply to the college board for
              that accommodation.
            </p>
            <p>
              We would need a doctor's note (a note suggesting breaks during
              testing with a reasoning / diagnosis) to attach to the 504 plan
              and then we can send it into the college board for approval. We
              have missed the deadline to apply for accommodations but we could
              still put in a form; I just cannot guarantee they would approve it
              before the AP test.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Welp. If that's not more proof the College Board is awful! Yeah. I
            give up. It's not worth the time. I can just struggle through like I
            always have, it's my last year in high school.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not that I need breaks, it's that I think I might. I just want
            that as an option. Nothing else. The College Board can't do the bare
            minimum. I already budged on two accommodations, but I can't even
            have the most simple of accommodations. Real stand up work, guys!
          </p>
          <p>
            I almost never use my 504 accommodation that allows me to take
            breaks during class. It's just an option.
          </p>

          <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            What you've probably discovered today is: it's
            <em>exhausting</em> to get accommodations. It's not easy. That's not
            to mention IEPs and 504 plans (the system public schools in the U.S.
            use for accommodation), which are a whole new beast that I am not
            qualified to write about.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I want you to take from reading this is that regardless of
            someone's "disabilities" that you think they have, what diagnosis
            they were able to obtain, and what you think they need to do to fix
            their problems, we need to accommodate people.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Everyone</strong> has unique struggles. I understand these
            systems are in place to accommodate people with well-known
            disabilities, and that often people can gain accommodations through
            social means, but we need to throw out our medical understanding of
            some "disabilities" (also see my Neurodiversity blog for info on
            this!). Requiring a medical professional to approve every little
            thing I could ever need helps <em>no one</em>. These requirements
            exist so that someone without "disabilities" can't fake their way
            into accommodations, but they're too stringent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often "high-functioning" people who are diagnosed with ADHD or
            autism are ignored in their needs because they can function fine
            without accommodations. I'm fully aware of the fact I could function
            without some of these things, but it would damn well make my life
            easier, and I have the reasoning to prove that! It's not my fault
            I've managed to internalize my "disabilities" in such a way that you
            think I function the same as someone you perceive as able! I'm
            telling you,
            <em>this is my struggle</em>, help me! Only to be rejected by the
            system because it doesn't think I've struggled enough. Not every
            struggle can be evidenced in grades, in stories from family, in
            evaluations from psychologists. Not every struggle can be measured,
            summed, and averaged. Some of our struggles are internal, invisible,
            and impossible to prove.

            <strong>Just trust me.</strong> I already got the damn diagnosis! I
            can clearly understand my neurology on a high level to some extent!
            The system was never designed to allow individuals to succeed by
            themselves, it was designed so doctors could tell me what I need.
            You're wasting my time with bureaucracy because you're afraid
            someone will lie. That's not my problem.

            It's ableist, it's classist, it's neuronormative, and it's just
            disrespectful to everyone who has fought so hard for themselves.

            These systems need to be easier to navigate, regardless of where you
            are in life. Rich or poor, diagnosed or undiagnosed, visibly
            disabled or not, I should be able to so much as <em>ask</em> for
            these things without begging a doctor to listen to me. I know what I
            need, the doctor is only a diversion that ensures able people that
            I'm "disabled" enough for them.

            Dear every "Department of Disability Services",
            <br />
            Stop glorifying the medical model in your assistance of autistics,
            people with ADHD, and other neurodiversities. It's not necessary
            anymore.
            <br />
