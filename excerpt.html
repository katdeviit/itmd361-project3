            <p>
              Recently, I decided to look into using my diagnosis in order to
              get accommodations that I thought would be helpful to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a senior in high school who has committed to a university, I
              was looking at the procedures at my uni for accommodations related
              to autism or ADHD. I was also looking at AP testing accommodations
              from the College Board (which I could write a whole blog on how
              awful the College Board is, but it's a story that's been written
              1,000 times).
            </p>
            <p>
              What I discovered is: It sucks. It really sucks to try and get
              accommodations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nothing, and I mean nothing is easy about the process. This is
              definitely something my parents are aware of, but... just. Wow.
              So, let me get into
              <em>why</em> it sucks. For this, we're going to use my
              university's guidelines for ADHD accommodations.
            </p>

            <p>
              <a
                href="https://www.iit.edu/sites/default/files/2020-10/cdr-add-adhd-guidelines.pdf"
                >Here</a
              >
              is a link to a PDF file from my university listing what is needed
              to request accommodations. I cannot stress how ableist, classist,
              and maliciously ignorant this document is. Especially for a
              college-aged student who is able to understand their own needs and
              self-advocate, which understandably is not a privilege everyone
              has, but how can you expect
              <em>anyone</em> to self-advocate with this type of work needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let me break down some of the things here for anyone who doesn't
              see my reasoning. First of all, having ADHD, a huge struggle of
              mine is actually doing things that I don't feel actively engaged
              by despite knowing and wanting to do them (executive dysfunction).
              There is no other way to describe this document, and what it
              requires, then as
              <em>unengaging</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              So on the very first point, this document has already failed to
              promote self-advocacy and is ableist. Of course, not every
              document that triggers my executive dysfunction is ableist. There
              is some level at which I should be expected to function, but the
              requirements are extremely excessive to the point of ableism,
              because the very purpose of the requirements is to
              <em>get help</em> and allow me to function more easily. The
              requirements are a direct hinderance to the ultimate goal of the
              document.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don't see why the requirements are excessive, I'm going to
              tell a little story. The first two requirements are for a full
              psychiatric evaluation from a psychologist or psychiatrist within
              the last 3 years. The last time I received a full evaluation
              was... 2011? 2012? I haven't been evaluated since I was diagnosed
              with ADHD. Why? It's not necessary.
            </p>
            <p>Okay, fine, so I need an evaluation. I can just go get one!</p>
            <p>
              Nope! Here's where the story comes in. When I was starting
              medication for my ADHD this January, I first was perscribed by my
              family doctor. After the medication I tried gave me severe side
              effects, my doctor was unable to perscribe me additional
              medication without me getting a recommendation from either
              psychiatry or neurology. Generally, psychiatry is the better
              option for evaluating what medication will work for you. So I
              tried to get an appointment with psychiatry. What I discovered was
              I would probably not get one until
              <strong>June</strong>. Six months later. Right now I would be
              unmedicated, in a significantly worse place mentally, and failing
              school.
            </p>
            <p>
              If it takes six months to get an evaluation, and I move in August,
              and I haven't selected where I will be attending until May...
              nobody will be getting an evaluation, unless they have money.
              That's where the classism comes in. Access to better healthcare in
              the U.S. is
              <em>highly</em> dictated by your income. So now we're dishing out
              accommodations based on income? Good look, guys.
            </p>
            <p>
              So whatever, say I get an evaluation somehow. Now I need an
              evaluation summary with a diagnostic interview? What is that?
              What? The only thing I can find out of this is "based on more
              sources than the student's self-report", which just screams "I
              don't think disabled people are able to understand their own
              issues on a high level".
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, I need testing that validates the current impact of my
              conditions on my academic function. Right, the "I am disabled"
              test! So they can verify I hate my life! Right. Here's a video of
              me screaming at how ableist you are. Does this prove that you are
              disabling me enough? Am I struggling enough for you? The point is,
              not everything is visible now, and some things are precautions to
              take because they might be an issue, and the bureaucracy doesn't
              let me change these things very quickly, so I'd rather do it now.
              I'll talk about this more later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh boy, point 5. "A specific diagnosis (not merely a reference to
              symptoms)". This one is the king of classism.
              <strong>NOT EVERYONE CAN GET A DIAGNOSIS</strong>. FOR MANY
              REASONS. The U.S. healthcare system is awful, and getting a
              diagnosis is usually just a challenge of seeing enough doctors
              until one agrees, or obtaining evaluations proving the DSM
              criteria (six months for that!). This is a challenge of how much
              money you're willing to spend on healthcare, or how much money you
              already have for health insurance. It's also neuronormative. The
              fact you would require this for something like ADHD or autism
              clearly shows you have no understanding of basic human respect. If
              you haven't read my blog on neurodiversity, I would suggest you do
              so, but the point is regardless of if you think I have ADHD or
              not, if I know that I have problems with executive function, I
              should be able to attain accommodations. A diagnosis should never
              be a pre-requisite for basic human respect in the form of
              accommodations.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I'd need a clinical summary with the following:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                An indication that other possible causes of the presenting
                behavior have been ruled out.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              So... You want my doctor to write this? "We thought he might just
              be lazy, but then we made him do sit-ups. While he wasn't very
              good at those, he tried. Therefore, we've decided he's not lazy,
              he's just weak." The whole requirement just leaves bad taste. It
              acts like it's my job (or, my psychiatrist's job) to prove I'm
              autistic or ADHD enough. It's gross. The words "presenting
              behavior" just remind me of
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis"
                >ABA</a
              >, which is basically
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"
                >Pavlov dogging</a
              >
              a person because you don't like how they respond to situations.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                A description of functional limitations and the impact of the
                condition on the student’s current participation in courses,
                programs, services, or any other university activities.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Here's something to consider. I might not <em>know</em> right now!
              I might not have these issues yet, because I'm not in university.
              What I do know, is myself! I do know that I <em>might</em> need
              some accommodations. If I know this, why should I wait until I
              have these issues? I can request them, try them, and if it turns
              out I don't need them, great! We'll change things up. This also
              limits my ability to get an evaluation, because this is required
              as a part of a clinical summary. That means my evaluation has to
              take place after I am already experiencing a need for
              accommodations (6 months more!).
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Recommendations for academic accommodations, including a
                rationale for each.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I will say, this is reasonable. If I were to do this myself (which
              I am not, I have to get a doctor to tell them this!), I would be
              able to rationalize my needs within the context of what I know
              about myself. If I can't, then I can have an evaluator do it, or
              have a third party write what they know about me.

            <h2 id="ap-requirements">AP Requirements</h2>
            <p>
              After discovering all the excessive requirements for my
              university, I decided to move on. Shortly after, I realized AP
              tests were coming up, and they're online, at home, and prime
              stressors!
            </p>
            <p>
              I also realized that during stressful tests where I don't know the
              majority of the answers (a 60%-70% on an AP test is considered
              passing and roughly average), I tend to get <em>very</em> stressed
              and need breaks. So I turned to my 504 plan! Breaks in class! I
              looked at the
              <a
                href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/getting-accommodations"
                >College Board website for information on accommodations</a
              >, saw the listed accommodations, saw "Breaks as needed", and
              thought... Wow, that'll be helpful! It said to email my school's
              disability services coordinator to discuss accommodations. So I
              did that. I emailed them with a list of accommodations and my
              rationale.
            </p>
            <p>Here is my email's contents:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I was specifically looking to get these that they listed on
                their info page:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Breaks as needed</li>
                <li>Extended time (150%) (only for math)</li>
                <li>4-function calculator</li>
              </ul>
              <p>My reasoning for the above are as follows:</p>
              <p>
                Breaks: These are already included on my 504, which makes things
                easier. If something is not going well during the exam I could
                get very overwhelmed, very unexpectedly. Breaks as needed allows
                me time to cool down if this happens.
              </p>
              <p>
                Extended time: When doing math problems I get very invested in
                my answer- if it's a decimal I might try to simplify or make it
                exact even if the decimal answer is correct or close to correct.
                This can lead to me taking longer than most people on math
                problems, especially in Calculus where there is a lot of
                estimation. The time is for more breathing room as I will
                inevitably follow some of my habits regardless of how much
                practice I do.
              </p>
              <p>
                4-function calculator: I can't do basic math under pressure, and
                a 4-function calculator when doing real world math is never not
                going to be an option. I could do mental math, yes, but it would
                hurt my head a lot. As I often say to myself when doing very
                "computational" homework assignments that don't include much
                actual mathematical skills outside 4-functions "I am not a
                computer". I am really not. Most of the points I lose currently
                in math classes are because I failed to perform basic addition
                or multiplication properly, calculator or not. I feel like the
                College Board might be harder to persuade with this one because
                of my good math track record, but it would be beneficial.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              How reasonable, drawn out, and based in my history these requests
              are! I sure do hope the College Board will listen!
            </p>
            <p>Here is the response I received:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Thank you for reaching out to me. I am so impressed with your
                level of self advocacy and responsibility! Way to go!!!
              </p>
              <p>
                Your current 504 does not have the accommodations that you have
                requested. The College Board typically only accepts
                accommodations that the student is currently using in the
                school. They don't usually let schools add additional
                accommodations that haven't been in place just for testing.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I replied, stating it was fine if I couldn't get extended time or
              a 4-function calculator, but that my 504 did include breaks, and I
              could probably get that. Unfortunately...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Because you don't currently have breaks during testing (written
                that way in the 504 plan) we didn't apply to the college board
                for that accommodation.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would need a doctor's note (a note suggesting breaks during
                testing with a reasoning / diagnosis) to attach to the 504 plan
                and then we can send it into the college board for approval. We
                have missed the deadline to apply for accommodations but we
                could still put in a form; I just cannot guarantee they would
                approve it before the AP test.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Welp. If that's not more proof the College Board is awful! Yeah. I
              give up. It's not worth the time. I can just struggle through like
              I always have, it's my last year in high school.

              It's not that I need breaks, it's that I think I might. I just
              want that as an option. Nothing else. The College Board can't do
              the bare minimum. I already budged on two accommodations, but I
              can't even have the most simple of accommodations. Real stand up
              work, guys!
            </p>
            <p>
              I almost never use my 504 accommodation that allows me to take
              breaks during class. It's just an option.

              What you've probably discovered today is: it's
              <em>exhausting</em> to get accommodations. It's not easy. That's
              not to mention IEPs and 504 plans (the system public schools in
              the U.S. use for accommodation), which are a whole new beast that
              I am not qualified to write about.

              What I want you to take from reading this is that regardless of
              someone's "disabilities" that you think they have, what diagnosis
              they were able to obtain, and what you think they need to do to
              fix their problems, we need to accommodate people.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Everyone</strong> has unique struggles. I understand these
              systems are in place to accommodate people with well-known
              disabilities, and that often people can gain accommodations
              through social means, but we need to throw out our medical
              understanding of some "disabilities" (also see my Neurodiversity
              blog for info on this!). Requiring a medical professional to
              approve every little thing I could ever need helps
              <em>no one</em>. These requirements exist so that someone without
              "disabilities" can't fake their way into accommodations, but
              they're too stringent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often "high-functioning" people who are diagnosed with ADHD or
              autism are ignored in their needs because they can function fine
              without accommodations. I'm fully aware of the fact I could
              function without some of these things, but it would damn well make
              my life easier, and I have the reasoning to prove that! It's not
              my fault I've managed to internalize my "disabilities" in such a
              way that you think I function the same as someone you perceive as
              able! I'm telling you,
              <em>this is my struggle</em>, help me! Only to be rejected by the
              system because it doesn't think I've struggled enough. Not every
              struggle can be evidenced in grades, in stories from family, in
              evaluations from psychologists. Not every struggle can be
              measured, summed, and averaged. Some of our struggles are
              internal, invisible, and impossible to prove.

            <p>
              <strong>Just trust me.</strong> I already got the damn diagnosis!
              I can clearly understand my neurology on a high level to some
              extent! The system was never designed to allow individuals to
              succeed by themselves, it was designed so doctors could tell me
              what I need. You're wasting my time with bureaucracy because
              you're afraid someone will lie. That's not my problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's ableist, it's classist, it's neuronormative, and it's just
              disrespectful to everyone who has fought so hard for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              These systems need to be easier to navigate, regardless of where
              you are in life. Rich or poor, diagnosed or undiagnosed, visibly
              disabled or not, I should be able to so much as <em>ask</em> for
              these things without begging a doctor to listen to me. I know what
              I need, the doctor is only a diversion that ensures able people
              that I'm "disabled" enough for them.

              Stop glorifying the medical model in your assistance of autistics,
              people with ADHD, and other neurodiversities. It's not necessary
              anymore.
